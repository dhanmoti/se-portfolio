# Software Engineer (iOS/tvOS & Google Cloud) - Portfolio [WIP]
Hi! I am an iOS Developer with over 8 years of experience in designing, developing, and maintaining high-quality iOS/tvOS applications. Proven expertise in Swift, Objective-C, SwiftUI, and MVVM architecture, with a strong focus on building scalable, efficient, and user-friendly apps. Experienced at leading cross-functional teams, driving the adoption of best practices such as Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Clean Code, and optimizing app performance to ensure smooth and responsive user experiences.

With a deep understanding of iOS frameworks, including HLS streaming, FairPlay, and DRM, Iâ€™ve enhanced app's scalability, reduced bugs, and improved overall performance. Passionate about keeping up with the latest iOS technologies, I strive to create elegant and maintainable code while fostering an environment of collaboration and continuous learning within my team.

Looking to bring my expertise in mobile development and leadership skills to contribute to an innovative and growth-oriented organization.

# [Placeholder design patterns and its usages]
Design patterns add significant value when applied appropriately and as needed. However, using them simply for the sake of demonstrating knowledge of a particular design pattern can create unnecessary problems. In my opinion, there's no need to solve a problem that doesn't exist.
<br>
In this discussion, I will delve into the design patterns I have utilized so far and the specific problems they addressed.
