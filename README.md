# Software Engineer (iOS/tvOS & Google Cloud) - Portfolio [WIP]
Hi! I am an iOS Developer with over 8 years of experience in designing, developing, and maintaining high-quality iOS/tvOS applications. Proven expertise in Swift, Objective-C, SwiftUI, and MVVM architecture, with a strong focus on building scalable, efficient, and user-friendly apps. Experienced at leading cross-functional teams, driving the adoption of best practices such as Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Clean Code, and optimizing app performance to ensure smooth and responsive user experiences.

With a deep understanding of iOS frameworks, including HLS streaming, FairPlay, and DRM, Iâ€™ve enhanced app's scalability, reduced bugs, and improved overall performance. Passionate about keeping up with the latest iOS technologies, I strive to create elegant and maintainable code while fostering an environment of collaboration and continuous learning within my team.

Looking to bring my expertise in mobile development and leadership skills to contribute to an innovative and growth-oriented organization.

Design patterns adds significant value if it is used as and when needed. Using it just because one knows this or that design patterns create new problems. I would say there is no need to solve a problem that does not exist.
Here I will dive deep into design patterns I have used so far and the problems they solved.
